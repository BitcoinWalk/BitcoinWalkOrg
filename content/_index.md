## Welcome

Put a summary of BitcoinWalk here

#### Manifesto

1. BitcoinWalk aims to onboard people new to Bitcoin and to speed up the Bitcoin adoption for both the local and global population.
2. BitcoinWalk aims to minimize exclusion by educating people on different levels of computer and financial literacy. We focus on the technologies and philosophies that can lead to a more equitable world. 
3. BitcoinWalk aims to lower the barrier to entry for anyone wanting to get involved; Be it the business owner that wants to save on bank fees, or the charity that needs access to donated funds immediately, or the individual that wants to save up for an uncertain future. 
4. BitcoinWalk discusses computer security in the most secure place - away from the keyboard. We discourage hands-on help, asking that conversation focuses on helping individuals to learn and try for themselves!
5. BitcoinWalk is run by no-one and by everyone. If you want to start a walk in your local area simply follow this manifesto and get in touch!
